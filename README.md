Project Name: OYO Corp. VWAP Future Projections

Project Objective:

The project focuses on predicting the VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) of Oyo Rooms Corp. based on its previous seasonality patterns using the SARIMA Model.

Database Name: OYO ROOM STOCK PRICES
    
Database Source: KAGGLE:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayankanand2701/oyo-stock-price-dataset/code

Model Process:

a) Importing important libraries

b) Understanding the data

c) Calculating the volume-weighted average price. [VWAP = Cumulative(Volume x Typical Price)/Cumulative(Volume)]

d) Extracting the trend from the dataset

e) Calculating ACF (Autocorrelation Factor) and PCF (Partial Correlation Factor)

f) Identifying the seasonality factor in the trend analysis

g) Training and testing of the SARIMA (Seasonal Aggregated Integrated Moving Average) model of the dataset

h) Plotting the VWAP for the future projections for 2024
